      <p class= "generalMentalHealthInformation">
    "Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood" (mentalhealth.gov).

      <p class="generalMentalHealthInformation">
        Mental health is a large piece of the puzzle of general health. For example, if someone was anxious about a situation at work or school, they might feel sick and be unable to concentrate. Mental health is often overlooked because of the stigma and myths around it. One common myth is that people with mental health problems are "choosing" to have these conditions, especially with eating disorders. People do not choose to have these conditions.</p>
        <p class ="generalMentalHealthInformation"> Another myth is that mental health does not matter as much as physical health. This disinformation is based in the belief that if one cannot see the problem, it must not be as serious as ones they can see. One could see someone suffering from a cold or flu, but mental disorders are not always visible. This does not mean mental illnesses and disorders are any less important to treat. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of over 48,000 people in 2018.
